Stream One Project for User Centric Frontend Developement (CodeInstitute)

Project Description

   Having completed Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Stream One, the milestone project was ready to be undertaken.
   The project was to create a Frontend, static website for a band of the 50's and 60's with HTML and CSS languages used with no Javascript.
    
   Rather than use the source material provided, I undertook to complete a website with a similar scope, but for an artist who is just starting out in their career.
   This would allow the same languages to be used, and the same instructions followed, but with my own personal twist and sources.
    
   The project acts as a website for Maria Lara (the client), a local artist, model and actress who is looking to design her own website.
   She agreed that this project would allow her to see what it could potentially look like and what functionality it could use.
   
   This site contains 5 pages: a homepage, about me page, contact page, music page, portfolio/photos page and video page.
   Each page serves a need for what the client required; a homepage to welcome potential customers, an about me page to detail who they are and what they offer, a music page
    to give an example of their music, a portfolio page to show the shoots they have worked on and a contact page to give details of how they can be contacted.
    
   The site also allows users to go to the clients Social Media domains at the bottom of every page of the site, allowing users to see other works of the client.
   
   The structure and link between each page is easily navigable with a head navigation bar on each page linking to all areas of the website.
   
   The color scheme uses similar colouring, and the fonts remain the same throughout (excepting the headers).
   
   Each page of the site is responsive, the design of which allows users to view the content on any mobile, tablet or desktop device, without any change in the style or appearance of the site.
   For example, in the portfolio page, on a desktop device, the images are layered 4 images across, when the page is viewed on a table device the images are 2 across, and finally 1 image on mobile devices.
   This enables users to view the images simply and more effectively depending on their device of choice.
   
   The site utilises Bootstrap in part, particularly the grid system (allowing for responsive design). HTML and CSS were used throughout along with semantic HTML5.
   
   The project was regularly committed to GitHub once sections were part way complete or completely finished, and the project was tested throughout using the 'Run' in Browser function (incognito Chrome) with the Inspect option of Chrome to style the different elements.
   Regularly testing the project allowed the site to flow better, with color schemes, responsive design and enabled the project to be completed more efficiently. It allowed for changes to code to be seen in realtime.
