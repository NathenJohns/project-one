# Maria Lara Webpage
Maria Lara Webpage - Code Institute Project 1

This milestone project, as part of the Code Institute User Centric Frontend Design curriculum, was created for a local singer, actress and model who wishes to expand her online presence and showcase her portfolio.

I chose this as my project material because, at the time, the project was for my girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend) who wanted to have a dedicated website to show her modelling photos, her songs, her videos and to have potential customers who were interested in hiring be able to communicate with her via the site or links to her social media.

A customer is therefore able to browse and see when she is performing, and send an email to hire her as a model, actress of singer.

# Demo
A live demo of this project can be found at https://nathenjohns.github.io/project-one/index.html.

This application is hosted on GitHub Pages.

# UX
The goal in the design for this website was to keep everything as clean and simple as possible so to best convey Maria to potential customers of her modelling, acting or singing. Customers are more likely to return and hire if the information is easily accessible and readible, with an easy to use and visually appealing website.

The purple, pink and black colour scheme was chosen because of the influences of jazz and colours closely associated with jazz. This creates a nice contrast that is sleek and modern.

The 'Home Page' gives an introduction and links to other areas of the website. The 'About Me' page gives details on what Maria does and her upcoming events (which aren't 100% correct but used as a refernce for future updates). The 'Music Page' has a full page media file with background image that a user can listen to. For the modelling aspect, I created a portfolio of some of her favourite photographs that a potential customer can easily browse. I only had one video available for the 'Videos' and unfortunately it is not with any acting as this could not be obtained; nonetheless it gives an idea of where a video can go in future. There is a final 'Contact Page' a customer can use to contact and potentially hire her for modelling, acting or singing.  

The navigation bar features throughout so that a customer/user can easily find their way around the site. The burger bar dropdown menu effect in the top left was a requirement that Maria wanted to keep the style visually clean; as opposed to a more usual navigation with responsive burger bar effect.

The footer features throughout and has links to her Facebook page, Instagram and the 'Contact Page'.

The 'Contact Page' does not have full functionality yet.

# Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4.0

# Testing
Testing for this project was kept within the Code Editor (Cloud9) and when deployed on Google Chrome using their dev tools. As the code is static only and does not require Javascript
or other programming languages, full testing was not required.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

# Features
This site was built using just HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. No Javascript or jQuery was used, although it could be used at a later date to create the Contact form funtionality.

To create full responsiveness throughout where Bootstrap couldn't solve issues, Media Queries had to be used. As an example, the 'Home Page' image when viewed on a desktop is a landscape photo, but the 'Home Page' is viewed on smaller devices changes into a different photo that is portrait.

## Features Left to Implement
From the time this was built we are no longer a couple and so therefore the information is no longer applicable (i.e. dates for performances and photos being updated.) Therefore most of the photos need updating and some of the design can be changed.

The 'Video' section of the website does not feature a video of her acting skills, as this could not be obtained. Therefore, a substitute video has had to be used. In future more videos can be uploaded to show a range of acting abilities and possibly music videos.

As above Javascript could be used to implement full email functionality on the 'Contact Page' form.
